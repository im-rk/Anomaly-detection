# Anomaly-detection
Anomaly Detection Using Isolation Forest (Unsupervised Machine Learning)
This repository contains an implementation of the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection, employing unsupervised machine learning techniques. The Isolation Forest algorithm is an efficient method for identifying outliers in high-dimensional datasets by isolating anomalies rather than modeling normal data points.
To use this project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the README.md file for setting up the environment and running the code. Dependencies include libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn.
